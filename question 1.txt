The MFT is the Modulation Transfer Function which is used as a parameter to characterize the sharpness of images.It is also known as spatial frequency response.It is the ability of an optical system different levels from the objects to images.
MTF=Imax-Imin / Imax+Imin.
For smaller images MTF<1
In general,MTF should be >0.5.
MTF=1 all contrast produced in this frequency.
MTF=0 no contrast produced.
