The correlation is the process of establishing a mutual relationship between two or more things.
(a) The methods to compute correlation are as follows,
                                                     1.Scatter Diagram Method.
                                                     2.Karl Pearson's Coefficient of Correlation.
                                                     3.Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient.         
                                                     4.Methods of Least Squares.
(b) Applications of correlation in Biomedical Engineering and Technology are,
                         1.Using correlation coefficient in ECG waveforms for arrhythmia detection.
                         2.Digital image correlation to biological tissues.
                         3.Cross-correlation method in cardiac output measurements.
                         4.Correlation hunting between alpha band power of EEG signals.
                         5.Tunable diode laser spectroscopy:Correlation between breath carbon-monoxide and low level blood carboxyhemoglobin saturation.
(c) P value in correlation is the level of marginal significance within a statistical hypothesis test and it is used as an alternative to rejections which are provided in null hypothesis.
p=r/sqrt(r^2)/(N-2) where N is the number of variants.
