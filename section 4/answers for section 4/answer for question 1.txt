SECTION IV:BIOLOGICAL STATISTIS

1.The hypothesis testing is a procedure based on some sample evidence it compares it with the null hypothesis and it is used to 
detremine whether the hypothesis is a reasonable statement such that it will not get rejected,when it is unreasonable and below the probability predetermined level
it gets rejected.
The seven types of hypothesis testing are as follows,
                                                     1.Simple
                                                     2.Complex
                                                     3.Emprical
                                                     4.Null
                                                     5.Alternate
                                                     6.Logical
                                                     7.Statistical
These hypothesis testing are  used in real life,business and in statistical solutions.
