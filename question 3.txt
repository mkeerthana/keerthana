3.Image processing tecniques used in the classification of optical camera images:
(1)FPGA:
      This approach used is a windowing operator technique to transverse the pixels of an image and apply the filters to them.
(2)CLOUD:
        The image processing cloud is built by integrating the image processing library openCV with handloop platform to deliver PaaS.
(3)FOCAL PLANE:
        Focal plane image processing refers to the integration of image aquisition and image or signal processing on the focal plane of an imaging system.
